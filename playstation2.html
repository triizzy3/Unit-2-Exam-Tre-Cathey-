                    <p>The PlayStation 2 (PS2) is a home video game console developed and marketed by Sony Interactive
                        Entertainment. It was first released in Japan on 4 March 2000, in North America on 26 October
                        2000, in Europe on 24 November 2000, and in Australia on 30 November 2000. It is the successor
                        to the original PlayStation, as well as the second installment in the PlayStation brand of
                        consoles. As a sixth-generation console, it competed with Nintendo's GameCube, Sega's Dreamcast,
                        and Microsoft's Xbox. It is the best-selling video game console of all time, having sold over
                        155 million units worldwide.</p>

                        <p>The PlayStation 2 is very similar in size compared to the PS1. The original PlayStation 2 has
                            a similar bulkiness to it as well. As with anything that comes after its predecessor, it had
                            advancements. The highlight of this system was its Emotion Engine processor that was said to
                            have more power than personal computers. The system also offered backward-compatibility for
                            its predecessorâ€™s game controller, as well as its games. The PS2 had an 8 megabyte capacity
                            and could output video resolutions on SDTV and HDTV from 480i to 480p, and some games, such
                            as Gran Turismo 4 and Tourist Trophy, are known to support up-scaled 1080i resolution The
                            PlayStation 2 supports the following standards: composite video (480i), S-Video (480i), RGB
                            (480i/p), VGA (for progressive scan games and PS2 Linux only), YPBPR component video (which
                            display most original PlayStation games in their native 240p mode which most HDTV sets do
                            not support), and D-Terminal. Cables are available for all of these signal types; these
                            cables also output analogue stereo audio. Additionally, an RF modulator is available for the
                            system to connect to older TVs. The PS2 introduced the option to play video games over the
                            internet into the PS family. This required using dial-up or a broadband internet connection.
                            The controller was more or less the same besides the inclusion of analogue pressure
                            sensitivity to over 100 individual levels of depth on the face, shoulder and D-pad buttons,
                            replacing the digital buttons of the original. Like its predecessor, the DualShock 2
                            controller has force feedback, or "vibration" functionality. It is lighter and includes two
                            more levels of vibration. Source: <a
